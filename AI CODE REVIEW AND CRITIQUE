Hello All, 

I asked Ai to write a php fucntion that adds workouts to a class and will return workout descriptions.

This is what it gave me. 

class FitnessTracker {
  public $name;
  public $workouts = [];

  public function addWorkout($type, $duration) {
    $this->workouts[] = "$type for $duration minutes";
  }

  public function getWorkoutSummary() {
    return implode(", ", $this->workouts);
  }
}



My Thoughts
The code mostly worked. I liked how it added workouts using clean strings. The addWorkout() method was 
solid, so I kept that.

The summary method wasn’t useful for me — I didn’t need one long sentence. I was looping through each 
workout in my view file anyway, so I skipped that part.

I made changes to fit the way MVC works in my project. Instead of trying to return a summary, I used the
workouts array directly in the view. 
The AI gave me a decent starting point, and I tweaked it to match what I needed.
